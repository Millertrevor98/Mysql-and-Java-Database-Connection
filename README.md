# Mysql-and-Java-Database-Connection

This is just a basic Java MySQL import project. The database is already setup just import the script onto your SQL server and is in the dumps zip folder. 
The Java file is in the practice program zip folder and all the connections have been written and tested all you need to do is
change your code to match your SQL server where needed.

I would recommend watching Wittcode on youtube on how to use a connector to connect Java and MySQL as it goes into further detail.
